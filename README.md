From an epistemological perspective, we have missed an evolutionary adaptation, visual pattern recognition, as a means of identifying relationships of interest in the data we generate. And although the premise "Cum hoc ergo propter hoc", which in Latin means "with this, therefore because of this", or more colloquially: "correlation does not imply causation" calls us to proceed with caution in the search for patterns between distant sources of information, it is perceived as of great value to advance in platforms and tools that make it easier for us to transform data into shapes and colors with potential as channels of knowledge.

In short, the opportunity to integrate a visualization with the potential not only to show data, but also to generate knowledge, can be justified under three fundamental pillars:

The vast amount of data available
The usual way of viewing information is subject to showing only a summary of what we discover
Our evolutionary ability to discover visual patterns

What
Open-source online platform for multivariate three-dimensional visualization of scientific databases with correlation potential through the detection of patterns or representation of their discoveries from the manipulation, discrimination and analysis of information.

Why
The complexity and abundance of information sources and databases from scientific research, represents a disciplinary opportunity that emerges from an exploratory integration using these data as raw material.

So that
Visually link divergent or complementary sources of information from open source digital tools that promote a form of inquiry based on the visual capacities of people and the scientific community.


objectives

General objective

Develop an online platform, which through the three-dimensional and multivariable visualization of scientific data, promotes a form of inquiry through the detection of patterns.
